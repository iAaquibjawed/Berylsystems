We can run ruby command using this following ways
1. Single command-> It means ruby run one command at one time from terminal 
	ex-admin@admins-iMac ~ % ruby -e 'puts 123'
	   123
	-e -> it stand for execute 
	   -> what ever the command is in single quotes ruby execute this
2.Ruby file-> In this we save a lots commands of ruby and save it with ".rb" extension
	      and it run.
	ex- admin@admins-iMac Desktop % ruby me.rb
	    123
  	    234
	    456
	 or
	ex- admin@admins-iMac ~ % ruby /Users/admin/Desktop/me.rb
	    123
	    234
	    456
3IRB. Stand for interactive ruby shell, we interact with our code in realtime.

	-> To launch IRB 
	->rib
	  ex- admin@admins-iMac ~ % irb
	      3.0.1 :001 >1+1
	      => 2 
	      3.0.1 :002 > puts 123
	      123
	      => nil 
	Note. Every line in ruby has a return value and here put command not return any things it just print the result no terminal 	      that's why it give a return as nil
	 ex-> 3.0.1 :001 > 2+2
 	      => 4 
  	      3.0.1 :002 > 4+3-3
	      => 4 
	      3.0.1 :003 > 1+8/8+4-9
 	      => -3 
	      3.0.1 :004 > 
	-> To exit from rib 
	   type quit or exit
	ex- 3.0.1 :004 > quit
	    admin@admins-iMac ~ % irb
	    3.0.1 :001 > exit
	    admin@admins-iMac ~ %
