Please note - I am using atom editor so some of commands outputs are not from terminal 


-> To print something on scene we have to functions

1.puts
2.print

1.puts -> it prints what ever you pass into it and also print new line

	ex- 3.0.1 :075 > puts "hello world"
	hello world
 	=> nil 
	3.0.1 :076 > puts "new"
	new
 	=> nil 
2.print -> it print two things next to each other

	ex-3.0.1 :077 > print "Hello World"
	Hello World => nil 
	3.0.1 :078 > print "new"
	new => nil 

  Note- on puts nil come on next line But with print nil come on same line

->how puts function work

puts "     / |"
puts "    /  |"
puts "   /   |"
puts "  /    |"
puts " /     |"
puts "/______|"

     / |
    /  |
   /   |
  /    |
 /     |
/______|

-> print with variables

	ex- name = "Sam"

age ="21"

	puts ("Hello my is " +name+ " Thank you")
	puts ("i am " + age +" years old" )

 	Hello my is Sam Thank you
	i am 21 years old

  Note - if you printing a string with variable inside it enclose it in parentheses, else   
         get an error
