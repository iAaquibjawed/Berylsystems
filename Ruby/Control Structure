Control structure -> control structure add dynamism to the code
		  -> it determine circumstances when code executes 
		  -> we use condition under which if this condition meets execute this line of code 
		  -> we use loops by which we decide how many times the code should execute
		  -> we also use condition in loops that if condition meet execute this
		  -> we use iterators which use object and for those object iterators execute the lines of code for each object 
		  -> Ruby uses the keyword end to signify the end of a body 
		  -> you can use multiple line of codes 


HERE'S THE TYPES OF CONTROL STRUCTURE 


1.Conditionals : if, else, elsif -> 

	structure of if ->

		1. if boolean 
			code .....

		   end

		2. if conditional 
			code....
		   end


	ex - 3.0.1 :038 > x = true 
	 => true 
	3.0.1 :039 > if x 
	3.0.1 :040 >   puts x
	3.0.1 :041 > end
	true
	 => nil 
	3.0.1 :042 > y = 19
 	=> 19 
	3.0.1 :043 > if y>10
	3.0.1 :044 >   print "number is #{y}"
	3.0.1 :045 > end
	number is 19 => nil 
	3.0.1 :046 > if y>20
	3.0.1 :047 >   print "number is #{y}"
	3.0.1 :048 > end
	 => nil 



	2.else -> we use else to execute that line of code if that condition is not meet
	       ->this is called default code mean if that condition is not meet it execute by default


	Structure of else-> 

		if condition
			code....
		else
			code..
		end

	ex - 3.0.1 :049 > if y>20
	3.0.1 :050 >   print "number is less"
	3.0.1 :051 > else
	3.0.1 :052 >   print "your number is #{y}"
	3.0.1 :053 > end
	your number is 19 => nil 
	3.0.1 :060 > if x == "sam"
	3.0.1 :061 >   print "hello #{x}"
	3.0.1 :062 > else
	3.0.1 :063 >   print "who are you"
	3.0.1 :064 > end
	hello sam => nil 
	3.0.1 :065 > x = "sai"
 	=> "sai" 
	3.0.1 :066 > if x == "sam"
	3.0.1 :067 >   print "hello #{x}"
	3.0.1 :068 > else
	3.0.1 :069 >   print "who are you"
	3.0.1 :070 > end
	who are you => nil 


	3.elsif -> we use this if we have more than one condition 

	
	structure of elsif 

		if condition 
			code....
		elsif condition
			code..
		elsif condition
			code..
		else
			code..
		end


		ex - 3.0.1 :071 > x = "sam" 
 	=> "sam" 
	3.0.1 :072 > y = "sai"
	 => "sai" 
	3.0.1 :073 > if x = "sam"
	3.0.1 :074 >   print "hello #{x}"
	3.0.1 :075 > elsif x != "sam"
	3.0.1 :076 >   print "who are you"
	3.0.1 :077 > else 
	3.0.1 :078 >   print "bye"
	3.0.1 :079 > end
	(irb):73: warning: found `= literal' in conditional, should be ==
	hello sam => nil 
	puts "Please enter your name "
	x = gets.chomp()
	if x == "sam"
  	print "Hello #{x} how you"
	elsif x=="sai"
  	print "who are you"

	 => nil 

2.Conditionals -> unless -> this is opposite of if statements
			 -> it act in same way putting not operator in if conditions

	structure of unless

	unless condition
		code...
	else
		code..
	end


	ex - 3.0.1 :025 > x = 12
	 => 12 
	3.0.1 :026 > unless x<12
	3.0.1 :027 >   print "hello"
	3.0.1 :028 > end
	hello => nil 
	3.0.1 :029 > i
	x = 1 
	3.0.1 :065 > x = 1 
 	=> 1 
	3.0.1 :066 > unless x>=2
	3.0.1 :067 >    puts "x is less than 2"
	3.0.1 :068 >  else
	3.0.1 :069 >    puts "x is greater than 2"
	3.0.1 :070 > end
	x is less than 2
 	=> nil 
	3.0.1 :072 > a = 20
 	=> 20 
	3.0.1 :073 > if a >= 18
	3.0.1 :074 >   puts "You are eligible to vote."
	3.0.1 :075 > end
	You are eligible to vote.
 	=> nil 
	3.0.1 :099 > a = 1
	 => 1 
	3.0.1 :100 > 
	3.0.1 :101 > unless a >4 
	3.0.1 :102 >     puts "Welcome!"
	3.0.1 :103 >   
	3.0.1 :104 > else
	3.0.1 :105 >     puts "Hello!"
	3.0.1 :106 >       
	3.0.1 :107 > end
	Welcome!
 	=> nil 
	3.0.1 :108 > b = 0
	 => 0 
	3.0.1 :109 > b += 2 unless b.zero?
	3.0.1 :110 >     puts(b)
	0
	3.0.1 :113 > unless weight < 85
	3.0.1 :114 >   puts "you are overweight, so you need to go on a diet and have pl
	enty of exercise"
	3.0.1 :115 > end
	you are overweight, so you need to go on a diet and have plenty of exercise
	 => nil 
	3.0.1 :121 > i = 4
	 => 4 
	3.0.1 :122 > 
	3.0.1 :123 > # Use an unless-else construct.
	3.0.1 :124 > unless i == 3
	3.0.1 :125 >     puts "UNLESS"
	3.0.1 :126 > else
	3.0.1 :127 >     puts "ELSE"
	3.0.1 :128 > end
	UNLESS


3.Conditional -> case -> we use the case statement to test a sequence of conditions. 
	      -> this is superficially similar to switch in C.
	      ->it provides an easy way to forward execution to different parts of code based on the value of the expression.


	-> there are three importants keywords we used in case statements

	1.case. it takes the variables that will be used by when keyword	
	2.when. it is similar to case keyword in another programming languages. it is used to match a single condition.we can use multiple when statements depend upon need with single car statement.
	3.else. it is similar to the default keyword in another programming languages.it is optional and will execute when nothing matches.


	
	structure of case->

		case expression|boolean

		when expression|boolean 1
			code....

		when expression|boolean 2
			code....

		when expression|boolean 3
			code....

		when expression|boolean 4
			code...

		else
			code...
		end


	ex - 3.0.1 :161 > capacity = 24
 	=> 24 
	3.0.1 :162 > case capacity

4.Loop -> loop in ruby are used to execute the same block of code a specified number of times. 


	SOME KEYWORDS USED IN LOOP
	1. break -> terminate the whole loop. jump out of the loop
	2. next -> jump to next loop
	3. redo -> redo this loop or traverse the loop
	4. retry -> start the whole loop over


	structure of loop -> 

	->loop do 
		code....

	 end

	this in an obsolete structure in loop

	while statement

	->while boolean
		code...
	 end

	or 
	until statement

	->until boolean
		code..
	 end
