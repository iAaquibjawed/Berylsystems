File Handling -> it is a way of processing a file such as creating a new file, reading content in a file, writing content to a file, appending content to a file, renaming the file and deleting the file.


  The puts statement

	 -> the puts statement instructs the program to display the value stored in the variable 

	 -> this will add a new line at the end of each line it writes 

	3.0.1 :001 > x = "hello world"
	 => "hello world" 
	3.0.1 :002 > puts x
	hello world
	 => nil 
	3.0.1 :003 > y= "next line"
	 => "next line" 
	3.0.1 :004 > x
	 => "hello world" 
	3.0.1 :005 > puts x 
	hello world
	 => nil 
	3.0.1 :006 > puts y
	next line
	 => nil 
	

  The gets statement 

	-> the gets statement can be used to take any input from the user from standard screen called "STDIN"
	-. it prompt user to user to enter a value which will stored inside a variable and then get print on the STDOUT


	3.0.1 :012 > x = gets
	hello
	 => "hello\n"
	

  Note -> gets add new line to the input value 
	-> we use chomp to remove the new line 


	3.0.1 :013 > x = gets.chomp
	hello
	 => "hello" 


  The putc statement 

	-> this is used to print one character at a time


	3.0.1 :014 > x
 	=> "hello" 
	3.0.1 :015 > putc x
	h => "hello" 


  The print statement 

	-> this method is used to print on the STDOUT 
	-> it is same is puts statement the only difference is puts goes to the next line after printing the contents where as print not goes to the next line.



	3.0.1 :021 > x
	 => "hello" 
	3.0.1 :022 > print x
	hello => nil 
	3.0.1 :023 > y 
	 => "next line" 
	3.0.1 :024 > print y
	next line => nil 



  Opening and closing files 


	The File.new method

	-> you can create a file object using File.new method for reading, writing, or both according to the mode string. 
	-> after that you have to close the file File.close


	a = File.new("new.txt","r")
	puts a.readline()
	a.close
	hello woeld 
	sam@Sams-MBP Programs % ruby /Users/sam/Desktop/Programs/ruby.rb
	hello woeld


	or 

	The File.open method

	->you can use File.open method to create a new file object and assign that file object to a. file. 

	-> the only difference between File.open and File.new method is File.open need block whereas you can not do the same using the File.new method.


	File.open("new.txt","r") do |fie|
  	puts fie.readline()
	end
	sam@Sams-MBP Programs % ruby /Users/sam/Desktop/Programs/ruby.rb
	hello woeld



	Reading and Writing file


	The sysread method 

	-> you can use sys read method to read the contents of a file.
	-> you have to open file in either read mode or append mode or write mode to read


	File.open("new.txt","r") do |fie|
	cont = fie.sysread(4)
	puts cont
	end

	-> you can specify the number of characters to read 

	-> here in example it read only 4 character
