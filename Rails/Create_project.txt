  How to create Rails project 

	rails new project_name

  by default rails use sqlite database


	to use different database you need to specify the database and tell them to configure you project with this database 


	rails new project_name -d postgresql


	to use mysql

	rails new project_name -d mysql

	-> we don't have a database with the name that rails give us
	-> we need to configure our database
	

	By default psql not gives us users to create 


	this will create a user with sam name in postgresql
	
	CREATE ROLE Joe LOGIN PASSWORD 'password' NOINHERIT CREATEDB;

	login with that user 

	psql -d database -u Joe


  Access Project 


	To run the project open terminal and run

	or

	rails server


	to stop the server type ctrl + c
