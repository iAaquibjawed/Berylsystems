Rails -> Rails is a web application development framework written in ruby programming language. 

	-> it is designed to make programming web applications easier.

	-> it is an open source Ruby framework for developing database-backed web applications.

	-> No compilation phase required



  It follow two major guiding principles:

	1. Don't Repeat yourself -> Dry is a principle of software development , if same piece of code will not repeat again and again, code will be more maintainable, extensible and less buggy.


	2. Convention over Configuration -> (it's also know as coding by convention) used by software frameworks that attempts to decrease the number of decisions that a developer using the framework is required to make without necessarily losing flexibility.



 Rails gives you three default environments:

	1.Development
	2.testing
	3.Production

	-> each behaves slightly differently, making you entire software development cycle easier.
